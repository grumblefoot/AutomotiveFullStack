# Getting Started with Car Shop Database
Car database is a shop management software, it contains records of service for all customers in a shop. It holds contact information, vehicle information, and keeps track of an invoice of each customer. Our current car database has a capacity to access the database with a specified authentication. As long as you have access to an internet, you and your employees can access the same car database store wherever they are.

This current project integrates to a local MySQL Server, although we have the script to connect to a database on Azure Cloud.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
To connect to the mySQL database, in ./src/server please run:
node mySQL.js 


//please nore that you will need to configure db.js with your mysql login info.

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install` 
to install necessary dependencies.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
